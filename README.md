# DSP48A1 Verilog Project

## Overview
This project implements and tests the **Xilinx DSP48A1 slice** in Verilog for digital signal processing (DSP) operations.  
The work includes RTL design, simulation, linting, and synthesis, with detailed documentation in the included PDF.

## Features
- Verilog implementation of DSP48A1 operations
- Testbenches for functional verification
- Simulation and waveform analysis
- Linting and code-quality checks
- Synthesis for FPGA implementation

## Tools Used
- **QuestaSim** – RTL simulation and waveform analysis
- **QuestaLint** – Verilog linting and code checks
- **Xilinx Vivado** – Synthesis and implementation for FPGA
